To add Bayanplus to your website, you will need to add the below this line of code to the `<head></head>` tag in you HTML file

The tracking script has `pid` parameter which has your project id and you must add it so the script can work. You can find it in the setting page of your project, it will look something like this, or can copy and paste the code from the setting page in your project directly

```html
<script defer pid="Your Project Id" src="https://cdn.bayanplus.co/bp.js"></script>
```
